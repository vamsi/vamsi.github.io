<h1 class="post-title">Hello!</h1>

**My goal is to develop and deploy AI systems to improve human life.**


My name is Vamsi Kurama. I am a software researcher and engineer specialising in web, compilers, orchestration, high-performance computing, and algorithms for Machine Learning.

I am currently the Founder and Director at <a href="https://caravel.ai" target="_blank">Caravel.AI</a>, An Artificial Intelligence research and consulting company.  I started my professional career out building web systems with <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank">Django</a> and eventually working on machine perception through the use of deep neural networks. 

I regularly contribute to open source and the author of the book <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Python-Programming-Approach-Vamsi-Kurama-ebook/dp/B07HB46QF4" target="_blank">"Python Programming: A Modern Approach"</a>, published by <a href="https://www.pearson.com/" target="_blank">Pearson</a>. As you can imagine, I am interested in technology as a whole, and software in particular.

When off path I tinker my projects, write and read a lot.
